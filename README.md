Hello everyone! My name is Chloe Foor and I am a second year honors student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison studying computer science and history. My eventual goal is to work in a museum, archive, or library. 
Currently I am working as an Associate Software Developer with Sentry Insurance and a Peer Leader with Wisconsin Emerging Scholars in Computer Science.
